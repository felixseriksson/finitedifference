# same as step 11 (same eqs, discretization and so on), but add a source term F for u
# F = 1
# ICs:
# u, v, p = 0 everywhere
# BCs
# u, v, p periodic at x = 0, 2
# u, v = 0 at y = 0, 2
# dp/dy = 0 at y = 0, 2
# no slip- BCs on top and bottom of box, periodic at right and left, imposed flow from left
